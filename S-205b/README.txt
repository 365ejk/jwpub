To run the script S-205b-E-fill-out.py that you've provided, you need to follow these steps. This script processes an input Excel file (from MS Forms), updates a template based on the input data, and saves the result in an output directory. Here's a simplified manual or run instruction:

Prepare Your Environment:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the openpyxl library, if not already installed, using pip:
pip install openpyxl

Prepare Your Files:
Place your input Excel file (the one you receive from MS Forms) in a known directory.
Ensure the script has access to the template file (S-205b-E-template.xlsx) located in ./template/.
Ensure the output directory (./output/) exists or create it.

Run the Script:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script with the path to your input Excel file as an argument. For example:

python S-205b-E-fill-out.py /path/to/your/input.xlsx
Replace /path/to/your/input.xlsx with the actual path to your input Excel file.

Check the Output:
After running the script, check the ./output/ directory for the processed files named according to the requestor's full name and the template S-205b-E.xlsx
