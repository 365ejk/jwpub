This script specifically populates the [S-205b] application form with the applicant's input from a downloaded Excel file from [forms.office.com]. 
It processes the input, updates a template with the provided data, and saves the completed form in an [./output] directory, streamlining the process of filling out the [S-205b] application based on user submissions.
